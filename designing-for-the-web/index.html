						<aside class="notes">
							I've seen developers and designers who didn't want to touch a single line of CSS or HTML.<br>
							HTML markup that browsers shouldn't even be allowed to parse.<br>
							Fantastic designs that would work perfectly on paper. But that's about it.<br>
							CLOSE> All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.

					<section>
						<h2>There's a lot to take in</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The problem is two-fold: designers have little understanding of web technologies and standards,<br>
							while developers are too much focused in learning an ever increasing complexity of the front-end interfaces they are required to build.<br>

						<h3>Designers must sit with developers</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							This is not anymore a timid suggestion...<br>
							No more designs slipped under the devs' door.<br>
							UI development (or frontend design&copy; Brad Frost) takes time and skills.<br>
							I've started helping developers to emerge in understanding UI development and design to a level where they can take coherent decisions and create a dialogue with designers, I'm also pushing to make the concept well clear to the companies I’m working with as this is not something that is usually understood.

							<strong>Bottom-up</strong> have devs sit with designers, understand the tools of the trade, elevate devs to focus on frontend design.<br>
							<strong>Top-down</strong> build a use-case, with users in mind, accessibility, usability and device agnosticism.
